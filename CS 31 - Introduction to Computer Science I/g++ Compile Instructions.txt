1. Open PuTTY
2. Load CS 31 Profile and click Open
3. Login as classuni
4. cd into Desktop/CS31/<relevant assignment folder>
	e.g. cd Desktop/CS31/Assignment_1
5. In Command Prompt, enter the command scp Desktop/<filename> classuni@cs31.seas.ucla.edu:Desktop/CS31/<relevant assignment folder>
	e.g. scp Desktop/original.cpp classuni@cs31.seas.ucla.edu:Desktop/CS31/Assignment_1
If that command results in a scary warning about DNS spoofing, 
then run the command "ssh classsuni@cs31.seas.ucla.edu date" and answer yes to the question it asks. Then try the scp command again.
If it still doesn't work, go to Users/eshan/.ssh and delete the known_hosts file. Then try the ssh command again. 
6. Back in the PuTTY OpenSSH Client, enter g31 -o <desired executable name> <file name> 
	e.g. g31 -o original original.cpp
7. To compile, enter ./<executable name>
	e.g. ./original
